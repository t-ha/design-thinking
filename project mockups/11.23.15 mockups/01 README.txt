1. Got rid of the hamburger menu because
	a) generally not considered good design
	b) having a low number of items in the menu itself looked very wasteful/awkward/empty

2. Moved the (homepage) search bar to the top like facebook/linkedin
	took too much space/looked clunky with the filters (All, General…)

3. I will probably add a Q&A filter later if you guys think I should! And any other ones.

4.  Got rid of the ‘write new post’ button on the bottom because
	a) you would probably only use that button while on the home page,
		so it’s now on the top right. (“inspired” by a lot of apps)
	b) needed space for More button

5. There are four buttons in More -> Customer Service
	i) Help
	ii) Contact Us
	iii) Terms of Service
	iv) Privacy Policy
	They don’t have any of their own pages. I was thinking of just writing them out of our scope,
		especially for things like ToS, but I can definitely add it in if you guys want.

6. For some reason I changed the heart (like) to a star. I think I was thinking that ‘liking’ something
	didn’t really serve a purpose as much as ‘favoriting’ something, but I used the work ‘like’ anyway.

7. I’m going to have to change how the ‘New Post’ page works because of links and other stuff.


Of course this is not a finished ‘product’ and I’m not married to any of this, so let me know if you guys want me to change/add/remove anything!
