# MyMajor
### Info 360 Design Thinking

For this project our group had to tackle a design problem that involved college campuses.
The problem we found was that students that were admitted into their majors had trouble connecting with those within their majors because prior friend groups had been established.
Our solution was to create a platform that could easily connect all the people of a major.
As a team we were tested and tested in the ways we thought and carried out our deliverable. Every design aspect of our solution has a justification for it within our design spec.

I was in charge of creating the mockups for our solution, a mobile app, work on the design spec and the project video.
